<h1>All the movies I watched!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 cop movies/series</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. The Rookie</h3>
<p>It's about a police depatment in LA who hired the oldest rookie in history called John Nolan. 
They share a lot of stories about his life and all of the other police officers.</p>

<h3>2. 911 </h3>
<p>It's mainly about fire fighters, but they work with the police aswell and I think it has a lot of good stories and deep stuff.</p>

<h3>3. Brooklyn Nine-nine</h3>
<p>It's more of a comedy series, but Andy Samberg being the main character I think it adds a lot to the series.</p>
